# Fixed Host Management & Leave Room Features - Implementation Report

## 🎯 Issues Identified & Fixed

### ❌ **Problems Found**

1. **Remove Participant Failing**: Frontend was calling `/notifications/rooms/${roomId}/remove/` but backend endpoint didn't exist
2. **End Meeting Not Working**: Frontend was calling `/notifications/rooms/${roomId}/end/` but backend endpoint didn't exist
3. **No Leave Room Function**: Participants couldn't voluntarily leave meetings

### ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

## 🔧 Backend API Endpoints Added

### 1. Remove Participant Endpoint

**Path**: `POST /notifications/rooms/{roomId}/remove_participant/`

```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
def remove_participant(self, request, pk=None):
    """Remove a participant from the room (host only)."""
```

**Features**:

- ✅ Host permission validation (creator or moderator)
- ✅ Prevents self-removal by host
- ✅ Deactivates participant instead of deleting
- ✅ Sends notification to removed user
- ✅ Proper error handling

### 2. End Meeting Endpoint

**Path**: `POST /notifications/rooms/{roomId}/end_meeting/`

```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
def end_meeting(self, request, pk=None):
    """End the meeting (host only) - deactivates the room."""
```

**Features**:

- ✅ Host permission validation
- ✅ Deactivates entire room
- ✅ Notifies all participants about meeting end
- ✅ Proper authorization checks

### 3. Leave Room Endpoint

**Path**: `POST /notifications/rooms/{roomId}/leave_room/`

```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
def leave_room(self, request, pk=None):
    """Leave the room voluntarily."""
```

**Features**:

- ✅ Any participant can leave voluntarily
- ✅ Deactivates their participation
- ✅ Notifies room creator (if not the one leaving)
- ✅ Clean exit process

## 🔄 Frontend Service Updates

### Fixed Chat API Service (`chat.js`)

```javascript
// Fixed endpoint URLs to match backend
removeParticipant: (roomId, userId) =>
  api.post(`/notifications/rooms/${roomId}/remove_participant/`, { user_id: userId }),

endMeeting: (roomId) =>
  api.post(`/notifications/rooms/${roomId}/end_meeting/`),

// New leave room endpoint
leaveRoom: (roomId) =>
  api.post(`/notifications/rooms/${roomId}/leave_room/`),
```

## 🎨 Frontend UI Enhancements

### Host Controls (Existing - Now Working)

- **👑 Host Button**: Toggles host control dropdown
- **📞 End Button**: Ends meeting with confirmation
- **✖️ Remove Buttons**: Remove individual participants

### New Leave Room Feature

```jsx
// Leave Room Button for non-hosts
{
  !isCurrentUserHost() && (
    <Button
      variant="outline-light"
      size="sm"
      onClick={handleLeaveRoom}
      title="Leave Meeting"
    >
      🚪 Leave
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### Updated Functions

```jsx
const handleLeaveRoom = async () => {
  const confirmed = window.confirm(
    "Are you sure you want to leave this meeting?"
  );
  if (confirmed) {
    await chatAPI.leaveRoom(room.id);
    alert("You have left the meeting");
    if (onBack) onBack();
  }
};
```

## 🔒 Security & Permission System

### Host Permission Checks

```python
# Backend validation
is_host = (
    room.creator == request.user or
    room.participants.filter(user=request.user, is_moderator=True, is_active=True).exists()
)
```

### Frontend Permission Logic

```jsx
// Check if current user is the host
const isCurrentUserHost = () => {
  return (
    user &&
    room &&
    (user.id === room.created_by ||
      user.id === room.creator ||
      participants.some((p) => p.id === user.id && p.is_moderator))
  );
};
```

## 🚨 Error Handling & User Experience

### Confirmation Dialogs

- **Remove Member**: `"Are you sure you want to remove {name} from the meeting?"`
- **End Meeting**: Modal with detailed warning about irreversible action
- **Leave Room**: `"Are you sure you want to leave this meeting?"`

### Success/Error Messages

- ✅ Success: Clear confirmation of completed actions
- ❌ Errors: Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- 🔒 Permissions: Clear feedback when actions are not allowed

### Auto-Navigation

- **End Meeting**: Redirects host back to rooms list
- **Leave Room**: Redirects user back to rooms list
- **Remove Member**: Refreshes participant list

## 📱 UI Layout

### Room Header Layout

```
[Room Info] [Connection Status] [Host Controls?] [Leave Button?] [Back Button]
```

**For Hosts**:

- 👑 Host → 📞 End (when expanded)
- ← Back to Rooms

**For Participants**:

- 🚪 Leave
- ← Back to Rooms

### Participant List

Each participant shows:

- Name + Role + Host badge (if applicable)
- Online status badge
- ✖️ Remove button (only visible to hosts, not for self)

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Host Actions

1. ✅ **Remove Participant**: Host clicks ✖️ → Confirmation → API call → Participant removed → List refreshed
2. ✅ **End Meeting**: Host clicks 👑 → 📞 End → Modal confirmation → API call → Meeting ended → Redirect
3. ❌ **Self-Remove**: Host cannot remove themselves (button hidden + backend validation)

### Participant Actions

1. ✅ **Leave Room**: Participant clicks 🚪 Leave → Confirmation → API call → Left meeting → Redirect
2. ✅ **No Host Actions**: Remove buttons and end meeting controls hidden for non-hosts

### Error Cases

1. ✅ **Non-host tries host actions**: Backend returns 403 Forbidden
2. ✅ **Invalid participant**: Backend returns 404 Not Found
3. ✅ **Self-removal attempt**: Both frontend and backend prevent this
