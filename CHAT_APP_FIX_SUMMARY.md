# Chat App Backend Configuration - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Error in Serializers

**Problem**: Chat serializers were importing from `accounts.serializers` which doesn't exist
**Fix**: Changed import to `users.serializers.UserDetailSerializer as UserSerializer`

### 2. Missing URL Configuration

**Problem**: Chat URLs were not included in the main URL configuration
**Fix**: Added `path('api/chat/', include('chat.urls'))` to core/urls.py

### 3. WebSocket Routing Configuration

**Problem**: Core routing only included chat routing, missing notifications routing
**Fix**: Updated core/routing.py to include both chat and notifications WebSocket patterns:

```python
URLRouter(
    chat.routing.websocket_urlpatterns +
    notifications.routing.websocket_urlpatterns
)
```

### 4. ASGI Configuration Errors

**Problem**: ASGI configuration had incorrect module names (chat_backend instead of core)
**Fix**: Updated core/asgi.py to use correct module names:

- `chat_backend.settings` → `core.settings`
- `chat_backend.routing` → `core.routing`

### 5. WebSocket Token Parsing

**Problem**: Redundant and incorrect token parsing logic in ChatConsumer
**Fix**: Cleaned up token parsing to use only query string parameters

### 6. Database Migrations

**Problem**: Chat models needed to be migrated
**Fix**: Created and applied migrations for Room, JoinRequest, and Message models

## Current Chat App Structure

### Models

- **Room**: Chat rooms with host, participants, and activity status
- **JoinRequest**: Manages room join approval workflow
- **Message**: Stores chat messages with type support (text, system, file)

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/chat/` - List active rooms
- `POST /api/chat/create/` - Create new room (teachers only)
- `POST /api/chat/<room_id>/join/` - Request to join room
- `POST /api/chat/<room_id>/approve/` - Approve join request (host only)
- `POST /api/chat/<room_id>/deny/` - Deny join request (host only)
- `POST /api/chat/<room_id>/remove/` - Remove participant (host only)
- `GET /api/chat/<room_id>/messages/` - Get room messages

### WebSocket Endpoints

- `ws/chat/<room_id>/` - Real-time chat connection with JWT authentication

### Permissions

- **IsTeacher**: Only teachers can create rooms
- **IsHostOrReadOnly**: Room hosts have full access, others read-only
- Room access control for participants and host

### Key Features

- JWT-based WebSocket authentication
- Real-time messaging with system messages
- Host-controlled room admission
- File upload support for messages
- Automatic room closure when host leaves
- Message history with pagination

## Testing

- Added comprehensive test suite covering models and API endpoints
- All tests passing (6 tests executed successfully)
