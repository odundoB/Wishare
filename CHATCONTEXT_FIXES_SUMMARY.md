# ChatContext Error Fixes - Summary

## 🔍 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Token in AuthContext** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: ChatContext was trying to destructure `{ user, token }` from useAuth(), but AuthContext didn't provide `token`.

**Solution**:

- Added `token` state to AuthContext
- Updated login/logout/checkAuth to manage token state
- Added token to the context value object

### 2. **WebSocket Connection Errors** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: WebSocket tried to connect even when no token was available.

**Solution**:

- Added token validation before WebSocket connection
- Better error handling for WebSocket failures
- Graceful handling of connection issues

### 3. **API Calls Without Authentication** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: fetchRooms() and other API calls could be made without proper authentication.

**Solution**:

- Added user/token checks before API calls
- Automatic room fetching when user becomes available
- Better error messages for authentication issues

### 4. **Missing Auto-initialization** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Rooms weren't being fetched automatically when user logged in.

**Solution**:

- Added useEffect to fetch rooms when user/token become available
- Proper dependency management for useEffect

## 🚀 Testing Steps

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:

   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Check Backend Status**:

   - Backend running on: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Frontend running on: http://localhost:3001/

3. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Login as teacher or student
   - Check if rooms load automatically
   - Try creating a room
   - Test room joining functionality

## 📋 Current State

### Backend ✅

- Django server running successfully
- Chat API endpoints working
- Database migrations applied
- Room creation permissions configured for both teachers and students

### Frontend ✅

- React development server running
- AuthContext now provides token
- ChatContext has proper error handling
- WebSocket connections are properly managed
- Error boundaries in place

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Login** → Automatic room loading
2. **Room Creation** → Works for both teachers and students
3. **WebSocket** → Only connects when properly authenticated
4. **Error Messages** → Clear, user-friendly feedback
5. **Console Warnings** → Suppressed development noise

## 🔧 If Issues Persist

If you still see errors, please:

1. **Clear browser storage** (run the clear command above)
2. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
3. **Verify both servers are running**:
   - Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/chat/
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001/

The chat system should now work seamlessly for both teachers and students! 🎉
