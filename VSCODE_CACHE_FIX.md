# üîß VS Code Cache Issue - Solutions

## The Problem

VS Code is showing TypeScript errors for a file (`EventServiceExample.jsx`) that has been deleted. This is a common IDE caching issue.

## ‚úÖ **Quick Solutions (try in order):**

### 1. **Restart VS Code TypeScript Service**

- In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type: "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
- Press Enter

### 2. **Reload VS Code Window**

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Type: "Developer: Reload Window"
- Press Enter

### 3. **Clear VS Code Workspace Cache**

- Close VS Code completely
- Reopen the workspace folder
- The errors should disappear

### 4. **If Errors Persist - Check These:**

```bash
# Check if file actually exists (run in terminal)
ls "c:\Users\user\Desktop\WIOSHARE\frontend\src\components" | findstr "EventService"

# Should return nothing if properly deleted
```

### 5. **Manual Cache Clear**

If the above don't work:

- Close VS Code
- Delete `.vscode` folder in your project (if it exists)
- Reopen VS Code and the project

## üéØ **Expected Result**

After applying one of these solutions, the TypeScript errors for `EventServiceExample.jsx` should disappear completely, since the file no longer exists.

## ‚úÖ **File Status Confirmed**

- ‚úÖ `EventServiceExample.jsx` - **DELETED**
- ‚úÖ `NotificationServiceExample.jsx` - **DELETED**
- ‚úÖ `ResourceServiceExample.jsx` - **DELETED**
- ‚úÖ `ChatTestComponent.jsx` - **DELETED**
- ‚úÖ `UserServiceExample.jsx` - **DELETED**

## üìÅ **Clean Components Directory**

All test components have been successfully removed. Your project now contains only production-ready components.

The TypeScript errors you're seeing are just VS Code cache artifacts that will disappear after restarting the TypeScript service! üåü
