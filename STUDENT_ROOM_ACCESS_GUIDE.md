## 🔍 **How Students See & Join Rooms**

### **1. Room Visibility**

**Students can see ALL active rooms created by teachers:**

```jsx
// RoomList fetches all rooms via GET /api/chat/
const { rooms, loading } = useChat();

// Students see room cards with:
- Room name and description
- Host teacher name
- Current participant count
- Room type badge (Class/Discussion/Project)
- Quick Join badge (if auto_approve enabled)
- Active status badge
```

### **2. Join Button Logic**

**Smart buttons based on room settings:**

```jsx
// For auto-approve rooms (Quick Join):
<Button variant="primary">Join Now</Button>

// For manual approval rooms:
<Button variant="outline-primary">Request to Join</Button>

// If already participant:
<Button variant="success">Enter Room</Button>
```

### **3. Joining Process**

**Auto-Approve Rooms (Quick Join):**

```
Student clicks "Join Now"
    ↓
Backend adds student to participants immediately
    ↓
Frontend shows "Joined successfully! 🎉"
    ↓
Student automatically enters chat room
    ↓
Real-time discussion starts!
```

**Manual Approval Rooms:**

```
Student clicks "Request to Join"
    ↓
Backend creates pending join request
    ↓
Teacher receives notification
    ↓
Teacher approves/denies in room management
    ↓
Student gets notification and can enter
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **API Endpoints Students Use:**

```
GET /api/chat/              → View all rooms
POST /api/chat/{id}/join/   → Join room (auto or request)
GET /api/chat/{id}/messages/→ Load chat history
WebSocket /ws/chat/{id}/    → Real-time messaging
```

### **Room Data Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Biology 101 Discussion",
  "description": "Discuss today's lab results",
  "host": {"username": "Mrs. Johnson", "role": "teacher"},
  "participants": [...],
  "room_type": "class",
  "auto_approve": true,
  "is_active": true,
  "max_participants": 50
}
```
