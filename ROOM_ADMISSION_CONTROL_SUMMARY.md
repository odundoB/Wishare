## 🔄 WebSocket Event Flow

### **Join Request Flow:**
```
1. Student clicks "Join Room" button
   ↓
2. Frontend sends join request via API
   ↓
3. Backend creates JoinRequest (status: pending)
   ↓
4. WebSocket sends 'join_request_received' to host
   ↓
5. Host sees notification & badge with pending count
   ↓
6. Host opens JoinRequestsModal
   ↓
7. Host clicks "Allow" or "Deny"
   ↓
8. Backend updates request & sends WebSocket message
   ↓
9a. If approved: User added to room, 'user_joined' broadcast
9b. If denied: 'join_denied' sent to requester only
   ↓
10. UI updates automatically for all participants
```

### **WebSocket Events:**
- `join_request_received` → Host notification
