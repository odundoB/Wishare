# VS Code TypeScript Cache Fix

## Problem

VS Code is showing phantom TypeScript errors for a deleted file: `EventServiceExample.jsx`

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Restart TypeScript Server (Try this first)

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open command palette
3. Type and select: **TypeScript: Restart TS Server**
4. Wait for the server to restart

### Step 2: Clear VS Code Workspace Cache (If Step 1 doesn't work)

1. Close VS Code completely
2. Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Clear VS Code workspace cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\Code\User\workspaceStorage\*wioshare*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\Code\logs" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\Code\CachedExtensions" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

3. Restart VS Code and reopen your project

### Step 3: Clear TypeScript Cache (Nuclear option)

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type and select: **TypeScript: Clear Cache and Restart**
3. If that doesn't exist, try: **Developer: Clear Extension Host Cache**

### Step 4: Reload Window

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type and select: **Developer: Reload Window**

## Verification

After following these steps, the TypeScript errors for `EventServiceExample.jsx` should disappear since the file has been properly deleted.

## Status

✅ File `EventServiceExample.jsx` confirmed deleted
✅ All other components are syntactically correct
⚠️ VS Code cache needs clearing
